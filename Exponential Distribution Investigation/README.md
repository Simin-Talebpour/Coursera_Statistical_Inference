I will create a report to answer the questions. Given the nature of the series, I'll use knitr to create the reports and convert to a pdf. 

I'll illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text, the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. I will show:

* The sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
* How variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
* The distribution is approximately normal.
